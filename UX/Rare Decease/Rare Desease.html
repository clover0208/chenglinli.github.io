			<p>In order to allow more patients to receive a definitive diagnosis, bring patients closer to medical resources, and improve their psychological well-being, we created an online mobile app community to provide them with information about doctors and hospitals, medical resources, and an interactive platform for making new friends.
				<br></p>
			<p>In the future, we look forward to partnering with pharmaceutical companies and bringing in donations so that patients can have access to medical care and medication. At the same time, we will pay more attention to patient privacy issues so that they can feel truly reassured and be hopeful for their future.

							<p>General Information:Among the patients interviewed in the 2019 Comprehensive Social Survey of Rare Diseases in China, 6,443 were male, accounting for 49%, and 6,792 were female, accounting for 51%. Nearly 90% of the patients are under the age of 50, and more than half are under the age of 18. Among the 6,598 adult patients, more than a quarter of them had bachelor's degree or higher education (25.9%), college diploma patients accounted for 18.1%, and completed technical secondary school accounted for 11.4%.
							</p>
							<p>Relationship: The research also shows that the social support available to primary caregivers is even significantly lower than that available to patients. The focus on primary caregivers is urgent. </p>

<p>In the documentary film "Born Extraordinaire - Profiles," the director finds that those with rare diseases are still in a mode of living a negative, repetitive, single life every day. She feels that many people with rare diseases over-exaggerate the label of rare disease patient  and feel that all their problems are attributable to their rare disease. This causes their mental problem.</p>
							<p>This is a documentary made by patients themselves. In this documentary, it shows that the patients rely highly on their family. So family members’ community connection is as important as patients themselves. How did the patients learned to make films? What other people involved? </p>

		<h3 class="insight-heading">Diagnosis<br></h3>
		<p class="insight-paragraph">The unfortunate reality is that rare diseases too often go undiagnosed for extended periods of time because patients, families and physicians have limited awareness of the disease and symptoms may not always be evident to healthcare providers who have never encountered it. 
		</p>
	  </div>
	  <div class="card">
		<div class="tagline insight-tagline">Challenge #2</div>
		<h3 class="insight-heading">Delays in Diagnosis<br></h3>
		<p class="insight-paragraph">Children typically wait <strong>six to eight years </strong>before being diagnosed. Delays in diagnosis can lead to inappropriate disease management as well as disease progression.
		</p>
	  </div>
	  <div class="card">
		<div class="tagline insight-tagline">Challenge #3</div>
		<h3 class="insight-heading">Misdiagnosis <br></h3>
		<p class="insight-paragraph">Patients are often misdiagnosed when symptoms present similar to another disease and a misdiagnosis can lead to unsuitable interventions for the underlying disorder. In more than <strong>40% </strong>of cases, patients receive a misdiagnosis more than once, as too often, “rare” can mean “off the radar” to healthcare providers. 
		</p>
	  </div>
	  <div class="card">
		<div class="tagline insight-tagline">Challenge #4</div>
		<h3 class="insight-heading">Access to Quality Medical Care<br></h3>
		<p class="insight-paragraph">Most rare diseases are treated by numerous specialists such as geneticists, neurologists, endocrinologists, dermatologists, etc. However, there are few places in which to seek specialized medical care for rare diseases, and due to the rare nature of these conditions, there may be NO specialists treating your specific rare disease. You will also be responsible for researching and coordinating your care, appointments, and therapy, as there is likely not a patient advocate, social worker, or anyone else to help point you in the right direction. Even if a specialist exists for your particular condition, it can be costly to see them. You must arrange for your own travel and expenses and Medicaid often places restrictions on where you may seek care.
		</p>
	  </div>
	  <div class="card">
		<div class="tagline insight-tagline">Challenge #5</div>
		<h3 class="insight-heading">Isolating<br></h3>
		<p class="insight-paragraph">Individuals and families affected by rare disease often face isolation. You may be one of hundreds or just a handful of individuals in the entire world with your particular condition. There may be nobody in your area, your state, or even your country with the same condition. Many people seek comfort, validation, and support through online community support groups, but this does not replace connection with people in your own community. 
		</p>
	  </div>
	  <div class="card">
		<div class="tagline insight-tagline">Challenge #6</div>
		<h3 class="insight-heading">Lack of Public Awareness <br></h3>
		<p class="insight-paragraph">The general public is largely unaware of the issues that face the rare disease community. They are unaware of the challenges the rare disease community experience in accessing medical care, treatments, and supplemental income. They are unaware of how difficult it can be to coordinate care and the stress this places on diagnosed individuals and caregivers. Most people are unaware that 80% of rare conditions have a genetic origin and that 50% of rare disease patients are children. Many are shocked to discover that scientific advances in rare disease research positively impacts treatments for other more common medical conditions. And most importantly, the general public is unaware that rare is not rare….that 1 in 10 individuals are diagnosed with rare disease, cumulatively impacting more people than cancer and AIDS combined.

				<p>RareConnect</p>
				<p>RareConnect is an online social network, created by Eurordis, which aims at connecting patients, families affected by a rare disease. The website is organized into disease specific communities which facilitate support and access to validated information, and allow patients and families share experience on their disease, on quality of life, on social issues. A set of features is implemented : communication tools like forums and private discussion lists, medical articles written by experts, texts from patients and families, testimonies using text, photos or videos, latest news from research, events concerning the community or rare diseases at large. The website is available in thirteen languages right now.</p>
<p>Share4Rare</p>
<p>The Share4Rare project includes the creation of a large social network that, unlike conventional forums, incorporates mathematical algorithms, such as those used by dating platforms. These will help to connect users based on the information they provide in their profile and it will make possible for people to direct their queries to those who are most likely to be able to provide an answer. Share4Rare will also help patients and carers affected by the same disease or symptoms to connect so they can support each other.</p>

		<h2>Interview I: with my friend Yandong and </h2>
		<h2>Interview II: In class interview with rare desease helping organization leaders</h2>
		<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Zvrs1VRMr5ZfnvOiRQnjP2dOUd1dXz7YH5XGoYNOK1Q/edit?usp=sharing" style="color:rgb(255, 102, 0); font-size: 16px; margin-top: 4vh;">Details are documented in this doc. Since we targeting Rare Desease Patients in China, our questions are designed using Chinese, but the summary is in English.</a>
		<!-- <p>My interviewee is Yandong, a patient with dermatomyositis(DM), he is now 31 and has been suffering from DM for the past five years. He told us about his own experience of being misdiagnosed and then diagnosed, constantly treated but then relapsing. When Yandong was talking about his experience, the most frequently used phrase was "I didn't expect". When he was recalling the moment he was diagnosed with DM, he said: "The first time I heard the word, I have no idea what a DM is. The doctor told me the disease was very serious. At that time, I could still walk, though I may cough and breathe heavily. I didn't expect the situation would be so bad". From his experience, we can tell that most people with rare diseases know very little about the disease they have and are not psychologically prepared for the disease they have acquired. In addition to material support like medication, psychological distress and support are essential parts of the community. That is why it is crucial to build a community of people who can provide counseling and complementary support to patients. Furthermore, older patients helping newer patients is also an important part of constructing a tight community. His experience of being misdiagnosed and continuously relapsing demonstrates that many doctors have very little knowledge about rare disease.  So the experience of old patients is also an important source of information for new rare disease patients. Yandong mentions that he was in a group chat consisting of DM patients where he shared his experience with new patients: “Every time a new patient comes into the group, he or she will ask how many years they can survive. I always told them that nobody can decide how many years you can survive, not the doctors, and not even yourselves”. For this unknown nature of rare diseases, old patients can give psychological help to new patients. Yandong said he is willingly giving up his autonomy and expectations.</p>
			<p>Another issue revealed in this interview is the relationship between doctors and patients. To truly build up a community benefiting rare disease patients, doctors’ comment and diagnosis is another factor needed to take into account. Doctors dominate the fate of rare disease patients because the patients are in a particular ignorant status and display complete obedience. This may lead to doctors’ imprudence and promote arbitrary and improper comments from the doctors which might be unhealthy for the patients. In Yandong’s case, before he was diagnosed, doctors replied to him with “you don’t have any disease”, or “you are very healthy.” This deepens the patient's confusion. Doctors, such an authority have no way of understanding their symptoms, which deepens the psychological burden for many patients and is detrimental to their treatment.</p>
			<p>In conclusion, on one hand, the relationship between older patients and newer patients is an important part of constructing a tight community.The group chat Yandong joined is illuminating as a method of forming the group identity of DM patients. The exchange of experience and information within such groups may help change the current ignorant and powerless status of rare disease patients. On the other hand, as the authority and one of the most important stakeholders, doctors should pay more attention to the actual feeling of the patients. By telling them “you don’t have any disease” actually deepens psychological burden for many patients. Doctors should be more conscious of the responsibility they shoulder as saviors for the patients.				 -->

		  <div class="card">
			<div class="tagline insight-tagline">Insight #1</div>
			<h3 class="insight-heading">Identity Familiarity<br></h3>
			<p class="insight-paragraph"> "The most important psychological building that new patients need to do is to achieve identity and identity familiarity, and it is important to provide them with <strong>a role model </strong>in this process. This role model is usually a successful person among the patients who can serve as an inspiration to others. Furthermore, one of the great innate strengths of the patient is their <strong>ability to empathize</strong>. Other people don't experience the same pain when they are sick, and it's only the patients who can empathize with each other."

		  </div>
		  <div class="card">
			<div class="tagline insight-tagline">Insight #2</div>
			<h3 class="insight-heading">Repetitive Labour<br></h3>
			<p class="insight-paragraph">Tech-savvy volunteers are extremely needed for today's rare disease communities to help build an online platform to provide frequently asked questions and answers and also relevant information for people to search for in order to reduce repetitive labor. Also, communities need to host online networking events to bring patients and other stakeholders closer together. Moreover, old patients need to play their role in a most effective way to provide new patients with as much help as they need.
			</p>
		  </div>
		  <div class="card">
			<div class="tagline insight-tagline">Insight #3</div>
			<h3 class="insight-heading">Helpful Method <br></h3>
			<p class="insight-paragraph">It would be better if patients themselves can learn some basic skills like managing wechat official accounts or filming. On the patient's side This might help them build identity recognition within their community by making their own effort and  not rely so much on others’ help. On the volunteer’s side, tech-savvy workers are extremely needed to build platforms or apps and may be hired as a paid job . However, other volunteers like managing wechat official accounts without payments maybe are harder to find than we think.

		  <div class="card">
			<div class="tagline insight-tagline">Insight #4</div>
			<h3 class="insight-heading">Right Doctors<br></h3>
			<p class="insight-paragraph">Another point is it’s very important to match the right doctors. In the interview, Yandong told me that he visited 5 hospital before he was finally diagnosed with DM. He also went from Shanghai to Beijing for medical treatment. Finding a doctor who understands rare diseases is really important for patients, saving money and resources. Also, finding the right doctors help ease the mental burden. Before being diagnosed, the doctors all told him “you don’t have any disease”, which made him feel confused and helpless.

		<h1><strong>Potential Solutions:Online Community App</strong></h1>
		<h3><strong>Implementation: Functions</strong></h3>
		<!-- <p>:</p> -->
		<p>1. Map: Patients can see which hospitals are closest to them. Click on those red dots to also check the doctors’ qualifications, resumes and research papers.Map:Patients can see which hospitals are closest to them. Click on those red dots to also check the doctors’ qualifications, resumes and research papers.
		<br>2. Forum: Patients can post their information to find those who have similar diseases.
		<br>3. Q&A: Held by the doctors in a certain time to answer patients’ questions.
		<br>4. Message and suggestion: Patients can enter their suggestions.
		<br>5. Collection: People can pin the post they like and the doctors’ information.</p>
	  <h3><strong></strong>Pros:</strong></h3>
	  <p>
		 1.It reduced repetitive labor of volunteers answering similar questions over and over again as frequently asked questions are provided.
		<br> 2.It helps match patients with the right doctor to get accurate diagnoses.
		<br>  3.It helps match new patients with the elder ones to get psychological support and exchange medicine information.
	  </p>
	  <h3><strong></strong>Cons:</strong></h3>
	  <p>
		1.Doctors need to focus on the current hospital system and this online community which causes double efforts.
		<br>2.The app relies on a community large enough to match new patients with certain doctor and elder patients.
		<br>3.Cannot solve the root problem of no treatment for those rare diseases. 
	  </p>
	  <h3><strong></strong>Possible Scenarios: </strong></h3>
	  <p>
		What if patients don’t know how to get access to our solution?
		<br>- Post information about our app to existing rare disease communities and encourage patients and their family to join our online community.
	  </p>
	  <p>What if we cannot reach out to enough doctors to join our community?
		<br>- Go to Medical Rare Disease Exchange Meetings to promote our app and encourage doctors to participate.
	  </p>
<p>What if doctors need payback after answering patients’ multiple questions?
	<br>- With the patient's permission, provide the doctor with the patient's contact information that can be used as a research participant in the doctor's rare disease study.
	<br>- Put ads in the app for hospitals that patients can visit, with doctors specializing in rare diseases.

		<h1><strong>Feedback from User Testing</strong></h1>
		<h3><strong></strong>Patient One:  </strong></h3>
		<p>
			-	 Displaying two sessions above the Q&A session is not convenient if there is only a fixed period of time to consult an expert in case of an emergency.
			<br>-	 It would be convenient to have a channel where patients can directly talk to doctors. Open a channel which provides the doctor’s contact number (like the QR friend code enabling the direct contact). It would allow patients to talk directly to their doctors.
		</p>
		<h3><strong></strong>Patient Two:  </strong></h3>
		<p>
			- Q&A session appointment function needs improve.
			<br>-	About Us: Privacy Policy: scroll page needs improve.
			<br>-	Introduction + Privacy of our app in a new page.
			<br>-   Users need to read the Privacy Policy before they can log in.
		</p>

		<h3><strong></strong>Patient Three:  </strong></h3>
		<p>-  Needs a introduction page or name: don’t know what this app is about
			<br>-	Add a platform that allows patients to submit medical history and documentation of their condition to facilitate physician judgment and doctor-patient communication, not the categories already exemplified. Let the patient choose to join the group because he may not know what his illness is
